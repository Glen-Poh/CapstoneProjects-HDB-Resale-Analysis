# Capstone Project: Singapore Public Housing (HDB) Resale Analysis
#### Heicoders Academy: AI100 Python Programming and Data Visualisation

In this project, we have builded a data visualisation to shed light on the HDB resale market, and provide key consideration parameters to help us make better decisions in choosing a:

(1) HDB Resale flat, or

(2) BTO flats that are likely to appreciate in the resale market
